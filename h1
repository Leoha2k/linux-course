# Summary of the Article "What is Free Software?"
# kwqk


## Overview:
Free software refers to software that respects users' freedom and community.
It does not necessarily mean free of charge; “free” refers to liberty, as in “free speech,” not price.

  ##The Four Essential Freedoms:

The freedom to use the software for any purpose.
The freedom to study how the software works and modify it (requires access to the source code).
The freedom to share the software with others.
The freedom to distribute modified versions to others.

  ##Free Software and Commercial Use:

Free software can be commercial and supports commercial development and distribution.
Imposing commercial restrictions would hinder the growth and adoption of free software.

  ##Distinction Between Free and Nonfree Software:

Software is free only if it provides all four freedoms.
Restrictions like "tivoization" or retroactive license changes make software nonfree.

 ##Copyleft and Licenses:

Copyleft ensures that modified versions of software remain free by prohibiting additional restrictions.
License conditions must not be overly restrictive to maintain the software's freedom.

  ## Additional Considerations:

Manuals and other practical works should also be free for the same reasons as software.
Terminology matters: "Free software" emphasizes freedom, unlike "open source," which reflects different values.
