# Summary of the Article "What is Free Software?"


## Overview:
- Free software refers to software that respects users' freedom and community.
- It does not necessarily mean free of charge; “free” refers to liberty, as in “free speech,” not price.

  ## The Four Essential Freedoms:

- The freedom to use the software for any purpose.
- The freedom to study how the software works and modify it (requires access to the source code).
- The freedom to share the software with others.
- The freedom to distribute modified versions to others.

  ## Free Software and Commercial Use:

- Free software can be commercial and supports commercial development and distribution.
- Imposing commercial restrictions would hinder the growth and adoption of free software.

  ## Distinction Between Free and Nonfree Software:

- Software is free only if it provides all four freedoms.
- Restrictions like "tivoization" or retroactive license changes make software nonfree.

 ## Copyleft and Licenses:

- Copyleft ensures that modified versions of software remain free by prohibiting additional restrictions.
- License conditions must not be overly restrictive to maintain the software's freedom.

  ## Additional Considerations:

- Manuals and other practical works should also be free for the same reasons as software.
- Terminology matters: "Free software" emphasizes freedom, unlike "open source," which reflects different values.
